One version is just for the online editor i.e. no file output, tested working https://www.online-python.com/ on DAAS


FileOutput Version outputs a text file with all logged events but can't be run in an online editor (because you can't create the file locally)


		Useful notes:

Use ctrl + c to interrupt python terminal

f.close() - closes file in case u need to delete the .txt

If you want to reload the .txt automatically on notepad++, go to Settings / Preferences, then the MISC tab and uncheck Update silently under File Status Auto-detection.

To paste as plain text is ctrl shift v
