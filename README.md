# Imp Template Generator 

Random Test IP: 221.241.59.100


One version is just for the online editor i.e. no file output, https://www.online-python.com/


FileOutput Version outputs a text file with all logged events but can't be run in an online editor (because you can't create the file locally). notepad++ recommended for this method as it has silent auto-refresh

# Useful Notes:
		
Program is easiest to use in Juypter notebook. Jupyter also lets you open .txt as well

ctrl + c interrupts python terminal but ctrl shift c (copying as raw text) does not (does not apply to Jupyter)

To paste as plain text is ctrl shift v to Teams if copying straight from Jupyter notebook<<<<<<<<<<<

f.close() - closes file in case u need to delete the .txt



you can directly open webpages in python using webbrowser.open("www.google.com") replace google.com with link for "create new incident in snow" in a new block in jupyter for more convienence

# Notepad ++ users
If you want to reload the .txt automatically on notepad++, go to Settings / Preferences, then the MISC tab and check Update silently under File Status Auto-detection.
